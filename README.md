## Service microservice

I will install the service app into the inventory microservice and
make my models and views to show the list of my model. I will write 
the paths to my views and check my work on Insomnia. I will add to 
my view function to handle POST requests. Build a React component
to fetch and show the list in the Web page. I will poll the car data.
I will implement the delete request and add a delete button to finish
off the microservice. 

## Sales microservice

My plan is to create the sales micro service to work in conjunction with the inverntory microservice make my models and views to show the list of my model. I will write the paths to my views and check my work on Insomnia. I will add to my view function to handle POST, PULL, GET, and DELETE requests. I will poll the car data to complete my requests and to finish it off I will create a React webpage for my microservice to function on.
